# Challenge-2: My Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for this webpage was to create a webpage, from scratch, that has a responsive flow and showcases my work as an aspiring developer. 

I built off this project to get hands-on experience with html and advanced CSS, including all of the new properties I learned this passed week in class.

I struggled with using grid and flexbox for the anchored images in the "Projects section", and I never quite figured that out. I did seek out tutoring, which helped me realize I needed to wrap my anchor tags in a div.

I learned that there are many different ways to make different code have the same result. I learned that CSS is very complex and there are different ways to accomplish certain styles.

## Installation

This is a singular webpage with external links within the images of the Projects section.
